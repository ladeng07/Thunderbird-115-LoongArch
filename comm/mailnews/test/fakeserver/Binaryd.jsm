/**
 * A binary stream-based server.

 * a user-supplied handler function.
 *
 * Example:
 * A trivial echo server (with a null daemon, so no state shared between
 * connections):
 *
 *   let echoServer = new BinaryServer(function(conn, daemon) {
 *     while(1) {
 *       let data = conn.read(1);

   *

   * @param {object} daemon
   *
   * The handler function runs as long as it wants - reading and writing bytes
   * (via methods on conn) until it is finished with the connection.
   * The handler simply returns to indicate the connection is done, or throws
   * an exception to indicate that something went wrong.

   * all connection handler. The BinaryServer doesn't do anything with daemon
   * other than passing it directly on to the handler function.
