The contents of this directory are from the MAPI Stub Library, formerly
Outlook MAPI Headers.

The files were downloaded from https://github.com/stephenegriffin/MAPIStubLibrary
at revision 01f9bf8cd2ac39078aabfc4662c873159efd75d6.

The files have been renamed to lower-cased filenames for cross-compiling
compatibility.

The content of the imported files was validated by comparing them to the
ones found in the Outlook2010MAPIHeaders.exe that was previously available
from MSDN. No differences were found that affect the code (mostly whitespace).
