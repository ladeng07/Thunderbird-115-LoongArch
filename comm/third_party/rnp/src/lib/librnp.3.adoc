== NAME

librnp - OpenPGP implementation, available via FFI interface.

== SYNOPSIS

*#include <rnp/rnp.h>* +
*#include <rnp/rnp_err.h>*


== DESCRIPTION

*librnp* is part of the *RNP* suite and forms the basis for the _rnp(1)_ and _rnpkeys(1)_ command-line utilities.

It provides an FFI interface to functions required for operations needed by the OpenPGP protocol.

Interface to the library is exposed via _<rnp/rnp.h>_ and _<rnp/rnp_err.h>_ headers.
You will also need to link to _librnp_.

Please see its headers for the full function list and detailed documentation.

== EXAMPLES

A number of examples are provided in *src/examples* folder of the *RNP* suite source tree.

*generate.c*::
Demonstrates generation of an OpenPGP keypair using the JSON key description mechanism.
May be used to generate any custom key types that are supported by the *RNP* suite.

*encrypt.c*::
Demonstrates how to build OpenPGP-encrypted messages.
A message is encrypted with keys, generated via *./generate*, with a hardcoded password.

*decrypt.c*::
Demonstrates how to decrypt OpenPGP messages.
Running this example requires the *./encrypt* example to be first run
in order to produce the sample encrypted message for decryption.

*sign.c*::
Demonstrates how to sign OpenPGP messages.
Running this example requires the *./generate* example to be first run
in order to generate and write out secret keys.

*verify.c*::
Demonstrates verify OpenPGP signed messages.
Again, running this example requires the *./sign* example to be first run
in order to generate a signed OpenPGP message.
