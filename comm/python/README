This directory contains common Python code for Thunderbird.

The basic rule is that if Python code is cross-module (that's "module" in the
Mozilla meaning - as in "module ownership") and is MPL-compatible, AND it
applies only to applications build from comm-central derived repositories
(Thunderbird and Seamonkey), it should go here.

What should not go here:

- Vendored python modules (use third_party/python instead)
- Python that is not MPL-compatible (see other-licenses/)
- Python that has good reason to remain close to its "owning" (Mozilla)
  module (e.g. it is only being consumed from there).
