# bug 1838108: on Windows 7 pre-SP1, AVX instructions are disabled, even though
# they might be supported by the processor. cpufeatures doesn't take this into
# account, so the assembly implementation causes illegal instruction crashes.
# As a workaround for now, use the non-assembly implementation.
