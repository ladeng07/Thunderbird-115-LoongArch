# I've derived this list out of timezones.dtd
# - replaced '_' with ' ' on value side
# - corrected 'St xyz' to 'St. xyz'

# This list is derived from the IANA timezone database, but was always
# incomplete. It will not be updated; future revisions will rely on metazones as
# defined by CLDR, but these remain in place to prevent regressions in
# localization.

# timezone names:
pref.timezone.Africa.Abidjan=Афрыка/Абіджан
