# As part of dynamic state partitioning, third-party resources might be limited to "partitioned" storage access that is separate from the first-party context.
# This allows e.g. cookies to still be set, and prevents tracking without totally blocking storage access. This message is shown in the web console when this happens
# to inform developers that their storage is isolated.
CookiePartitionedForeign2=Partitioned cookie or storage access was provided to “%1$S” because it is loaded in the third-party context and dynamic state partitioning is enabled.
