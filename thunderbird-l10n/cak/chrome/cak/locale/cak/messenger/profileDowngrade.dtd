<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE:
 This UI can be most easily shown by modifying the version in compatibility.ini
 to a newer version and then starting Thunderbird.
 For this feature, "installation" is used to mean "this discrete download of
 Thunderbird" and "version" is used to mean "the specific revision number of a
 given Thunderbird channel". These terms are not synonymous.
