#
# Purpose:
#   This is a wrapper script for starting the thunderbird binary with taking
#   care of the searching for an old user Icedove profile folder and adopting
#   the folder into the new place if possible.
#
# Environment:
#   The Icedove binary was using the profile folder '${HOME}/.icedove'. The
#   Mozilla default for the Thunderbird binary is '${HOME}/.thunderbird'.
#   The script will looking for the old profile folder and will symlink the
#   folder '${HOME}/.thunderbird' to the profile folder '${HOME}/.icedove'.
