AppArmor policy
---------------

The thunderbird package includes an AppArmor profile
(/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.thunderbird). This profile is disabled by
default because it has to break a number of common use cases in order
to provide meaningful application confinement.

If you want to trade additional security against potential
functionality breakage, you can enable this profile by running:

    sudo rm /etc/apparmor.d/disable/usr.bin.thunderbird && \
    sudo apparmor_parser -r -T -W /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.thunderbird

To display the current state of the Thunderbird profile, run:

    sudo apt install jq && \
    sudo aa-status  --pretty-json | jq .profiles.thunderbird

To debug issues with this AppArmor profile, see:

This AppArmor profile is maintained collaboratively, in
a cross-distribution manner, within the AppArmor upstream project.
You can report issues or propose improvements there:
